# PulseOfDigits

Technologies:
Javascript with p5.js library

I am not a programmer. But I like to study.
This project will just show that I figured out some simple things.


Requirements for the project:
1) Given the X and Y coordinates of the contours of digits (0 ... 9) - DONE
2) The contours are displayed on the screen as dots - DONE
3) The dots move to the given coordinates according to the described law  - DONE (mathematical model taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4&list=WL&index=6)
4) Dots are "bounced" from the mouse cursor according to the described law  - TODO
5) The position of the dots "pulsates" by timeout
6) The digits change from 9 to 0 and back when you hover the mouse cursor
7) If the digits have a different number of dots, then the extra dots move outside the screen and are deleted, and the missing ones appear from outside the screen
